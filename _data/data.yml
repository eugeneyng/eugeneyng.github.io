  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I am a technical project manager with 5+ years experience managing fast-paced and requirement-heavy military and commercial contracts. Projects are typically very customer-focused and results-oriented, and require coordination between multiple customers and suppliers. I am a highly curious and active business owner, having won or finalized in multiple design challenges (HeroX, YCombinator) with Presque Labs LLC. In my free time I love to stay active and play volleyball, tennis, and ski.
